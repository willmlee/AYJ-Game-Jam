Problem: <br>
Solution: <br>
Application: We modified the game, adding a shield as well as different effects such as sounds and camera shakes.<br>
Techstack: Github, Codecademy, p5.js<br>

### Reflection
This project has allowed us to learn how to code using "Phaser.js", a useful language for game development. Before this project, we learnt the basics of Phaser through Codecademy, learning things such as the basics, physics, animations and visual effects. (add more)
