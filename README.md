# AYJ-Game-Jam

### Possible additions
-power-ups<br>
-more than one "bug repellent" shot at a time<br>
-second player <br>

### Additions
-faster "bug repellent" <br>
-improved lose/win screen <br>
-barrier <br>
-camera shake when player is hit<br>

### Issues
-scenes are not playing in correct order <br>
-do not know how to integrate the scenes into config in game.js <br>
-scenes not switching <br>

### Working Proposal
Idea: Modify the Codecademy project "Bug Invaders", and create a new game.<br><br>
Problem: The codecademy "bug invaders" game was too bland, it was the same game over and over again.<br><br>
Solution: We decided to add a randomized shield, as well as more sounds and a different background colour. We wanted to add more levels, increasing in difficulty as the user progressed, unfortunately we were unable to get the scenes to work properly.<br><br>
Application: We modified the game, adding a shield as well as different effects such as sounds and camera shakes.<br><br>
Techstack: Github, Codecademy, Phaser.js, Codecademy sounds and images<br>

### Reflection
This project has allowed us to learn how to code using "Phaser.js", a useful language for game development. Before this project, we learnt the basics of Phaser through Codecademy, learning things such as the basics, physics, animations and visual effects, along with learning how to use Codecademy's library of images and sounds. We also learnt how to work through our own problems through looking for different resources with information on how to code with Phaser.js such as (insert website). This project has also allowed for the opportunity to learn to collaboratively code with others through GitHub.
